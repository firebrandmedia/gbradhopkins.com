For those of you who are left handed, you know what it is like living in a right handed world. Nothing works the way you want. Using the mouse properties control panel, you can finally make something work the way you like.

Mouse Properties Control Panel</b> : To get to the Mouse Properties Control Panel click on the Start Menu and go to Settings. Inside the Settings Menu you will click on Control Panels. This will bring up the Control Panels Folder which will contain the Mouse Control Panel Icon. Double Clicking on the Mouse Icon will bring up the Mouse Properties Dialog Box (*image below*).

By default the Mouse will be set as Right-Handed. To change it to left-handed, simply click inside the circle next to Left-Handed. This will make the Right mouse button your main button and the Left mouse button your secondary button.
