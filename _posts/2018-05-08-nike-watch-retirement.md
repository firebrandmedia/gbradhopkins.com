I've been a dedicated user of running products in the Nike ecosystem since the original launch of the [Nike+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike%2B) back in May of 2006. In that time, I've logged over 4400 miles using various devices, including the Nike+ iPod, Nike+ Smartwatch and now, the Nike Run Club app. It's safe to say that I'm committed to Nike products.

On June 11, 2013 I ordered a [Nike+ SportWatch GPS Powered by TomTom ($168.27)](https://amzn.to/2rrkcPW). This was around the time that smartwatches were starting to come on the market. I remember wearing my sportwatch to my son's field day and being asked if it was a smartwatch.

Initially, I used the Nike+ smartwatch almost exclusively but, after a bad experience in which a number of runs were not synchronized properly, I began to use the watch less frequently. I still used it on occassion, primarily when I wanted to get out and run without my phone (or, when the phone didn't have a sufficient charge).

On April 16, 2018, I received the following email from Nike:

The watch still works. You can tell time with it and track your runs, but they'll no longer synchronize with your Nike account.

I guess we call this progress.
