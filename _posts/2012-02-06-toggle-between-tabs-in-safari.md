![Safari Tabs](http://gbradhopkins.com/images/uploads/tutorials/tabs.JPG)
Need a quick way to toggle between tabs in Safari using keyboard shortcuts? 

I’m a big fan of keyboard shortcuts - anything that keeps my hands on the keyboard makes me happy, and more efficient - so when a friend asked if there was a way to toggle between open tabs I thought, “Why didn’t I think of that?”

I often have between 5 and 10 browser tabs open at a time and switching between them using using the touchpad is decidedly inefficient.

As it turns out, of course there is.

**Toggle Forward**

![Keyboard command for toggling forward - command-shift-]][1]

Command - Shift - ]

**Toggle Backward**

![Keyboard command for toggling forward - command-shift-]][2]

Command - Shift - [

This keyboard combination also works in Firefox and Chrome as well.
