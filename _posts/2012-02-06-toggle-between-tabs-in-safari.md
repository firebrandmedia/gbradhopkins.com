Need a quick way to toggle between tabs in Safari (or, pretty much any other browser) using keyboard shortcuts?

I’m a big fan of keyboard shortcuts - anything that keeps my hands on the keyboard makes me happy, and more efficient - so when a friend asked if there was a way to toggle between open tabs I thought, “Why didn’t I think of that?”

I often have between 5 and 10 browser tabs open at a time and switching between them using using the touchpad is decidedly inefficient.

As it turns out, of course there is.

**Toggle Forward**

`Command - Shift - ]`

**Toggle Backward**

`Command - Shift - [`

This keyboard combination also works in Firefox and Chrome as well.
