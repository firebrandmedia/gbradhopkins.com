Getting the hang of double-clicking is often a difficult task for new computer users. It can also be a problem for those with less than steady hands. In Windows, there is a simple solution to this problem and it is found in the Folder Options control panel.

Do the following to find the Folder Options control panel:  
  
1.  Click on the *Start Menu*.  
    *   Go to the *Settings Menu* and then click on the *Control Panels* folder.  
        *   Find the *Folder Options* control panel and double click on it. [*In the image below, you can see that the icon for the Folder Options control panel has an orange square around it.*]  
            </ol>
              
              
            
            
              
              
            
            
            ![][1]
            
              
              
            
            
              
              
            
            
            In the General Tab of the Folder Options control panel find the section called ‘Click items as follows’ [*in the image above this section has an orange square around it*]. Select, *Single-Click to open an item*, to change from double-click to single-click. Click Apply and then OK. 
            
              
              
            
            
            Now, every icon on your desktop will have the name underlined, much like a link on a web page, and you will only have to click on it once.
