What is a screenshot? Screenshots are pictures of items on your computer screen. In this tutorial I’ll show you how to easily take a screenshot of whatever is on your screen.

Why would you want to take a screenshot? The main reason I take screenshots are for use with tutorials like this one but there could be any number of uses of screenshots.  
**Print Screen** : The key to taking a screenshot in Windows is the Print Screen button (often abbreviated Prnt Scrn). To take a screenshot, hit this button on your keyboard and then open an image editor (Paint or some other image editing program). While in your image editor, open a new document and then click on Paste. This will paste the screenshot that you just took into that new document. Now you can save, print or do anything you want with the screenshot.

  
  


**How does this work**? : When you hit Prnt Scrn, Windows copies everything it sees on the screen at that time (just like you would copy text from a Word document). That’s all there is to it.
