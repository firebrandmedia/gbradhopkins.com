I recently spotlighted some tools from Google that you may not have heard of ([The Best Google Tools You’ve Never Used][1]). Well, the guys at Google are at it again. Google will now provide 4 day weather forcasts through a simple search.

To use this new tool, simply type in the following; “weather zip code” or “weather city, state” (“weather 26505” or “weather morgantown, wv”. Once you hit the search button, you’ll get current coditions and a 4 day forcast.

The search must be done as a phrase search, meaning you have to have it in quotation marks.

This is a nice way to quickly find out the weather in various cities, without having to deal with the increasing ads that are on sites like weather.com.
