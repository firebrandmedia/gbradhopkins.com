Changing the resolution of your screen can greatly change the way things look on your screen. Text too small? Change your screen resolution.

Changing the size of your desktop is done by changing the resolution of your screen. Here are the steps:  
  
1.  Right Click on your desktop (anywhere except on an icon).  
    *   Select [click on] Properties. The *Display Properties* dialog box will open.  
        *   Click on the Settings Tab.  
            *   Find the *Screen Area* Slider.   
                *   To make your screen area smaller, drag the slider toward *less*. To make your screen area larger, drag your slider toward *more*. [Generally, 800 X 600 or 1024 X 768 are the best settings.]  
                    *   Once you have adjusted the screen to the desired size, click *Apply*.  
                        *   You will get a message saying that Windows will now re size your desktop. Click *OK*.  
                            *   Your computer will now re size your screen and then ask you if you want to keep the new setting.  
                                *   Click *Yes* or No and then click OK to close the display properties dialog box.</p>
