Among the software updates that were included in MacOS 10.4 (Tiger) was an update to the DVD Player (version 4.5) that is included with the OS. This was a welcome update, as the DVD Player was seriously lacking in some respects.

DVD Video Zoom: Magnify the video image to reduce or eliminate the letterbox bars that appear on some DVDs while maintaining high video quality.  
Dock Icon: Play DVDs live on the Dock when the DVD window is minimized (requires Quartz Extreme).  
High Definition: Play DVD Studio Pro 4 authored high-definition video from HD DVD discs and hard drives.DVD Player 4.6 delivers added support for DVD Studio Pro 4 authored HD DVDs. It is recommended for all users of DVD Player.
