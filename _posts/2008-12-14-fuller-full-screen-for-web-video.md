Occasionally I’ll watch Sunday night NFL games on the [NBCSports.com][1] website.  The NBCSports.com video player allows you to watch video full-screen.  The problem is that even when watching full-screen, you’ve got wasted space to allow for the different camera angles that they offer.

[NFL on NBC Video Player Window - Full-screen][2]

Here’s two ways to increase the size of full-screen video using a built-in MacOS X shortcut.

**Use your Scroll Wheel**  
If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, hold in the control key and scroll toward the front of the mouse (as if you were scrolling up a page) to Zoom.  To scroll out, simply hold the control key and scroll toward the back of the mouse (as if you were scrolling down a page).

**No Scroll Wheel? No Problem**  
You can also use a keyboard command to achieve the same effect.

To Zoom-In on your screen use the following key combination:   
**Option Command =** (equal or plus sign).  
![Zoom-In][3]

To Zoom-Out use the following key combination:   
**Option Command -** (dash or minus).

NOTE - You cannot use the + or - on the numeric keypad to zoom in or out.
