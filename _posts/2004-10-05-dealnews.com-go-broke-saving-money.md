Looking for a way to save money online? Aren’t we all? At dealnews.com, you’ll find tons of deals on everything from Quiznos subs to Fredericks of Hollywood. Oh yeah, there’s a bunch of computer deals too!

How to go broke saving money. Probably the greatest tag line of any web site that I’ve seen. 

[Dealnews.com][1] is a great web site/community for anyone searching for deals of all types. At first glance, the site seems to be geared to Computer Supplies (and typically it is) but Dealnews.com offers an array of links to coupons, closeouts, exclusive pricing deals and more. In addition to their "deals", they also have a lively [forum][2] (message board) where visitors discuss everything from the news of the day to answering tech support questions. 

As you browse the home page of the Dealnews.com site, you will notice some great resources for finding deals. My current favorite is the ‘[Top Reader Picks][3]’ which they bill as a ‘one-stop bargain hunting tool for power shoppers’.  They list the top nine reader picks on every page but also offer the top five in every category (Systems, handhelds, storage, etc.).  Dealnews also offers [email alerts][4] which will alert you when they have a deal on a product that you specify (chose by keyword, category or vendor). 

Being a Mac user, I frequently visit their Mac section ([dealmac][5]) for current deals on Mac-specific products. The site also includes [dealram][6] (current prices on all types of ram), [dealcam][7] (digital still and video cameras), [dealink][8] (for those seeking great ink prices) and [dealcoupon][9] (a listing of online coupons). 

Finally, if you are own a web site, and you like to win things (who doesn’t) then you may want to consider participating in the [Link-To Dealnews.com][10] program ([rules][11]). By placing a link on your web site, you become eligible for a monthly giveaway. This months prize is an iPod mini. To participate, you must sign up at the dealnews.com site and then place the code on your page.

Here is the current code for the dealnews.com link-to program:

**dealnews.com**  
The best news source for   
[awesome iPod prices][12].

As you can see, it’s very unobtrusive.

Whether you need to buy a new hard drive, are looking for cheap ink, or are just looking for a way to spend that disposable income, dealnews.com is a good place to start. I would recommend that be at or near the top of your shopping list.
