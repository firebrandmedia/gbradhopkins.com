Quicktime 6 (Pro) can be used to do simple video editing such as cutting a video, splicing together video, applying a filter to the video and adding sound tracks.

Selecting Video</b> : To do any editing of your video, you must first select the video that you want to trim. This is done by moving the selection sliders (image 1) to the area that you want to trim (image 2).

**Trimming Unwanted Video** : Often times you will have video that you want to put on a web site but it may be too long or contain video that you donâ€™t want to include. To trim your video, you must first select the video that you want to trim using the instructions above. Once you have selected the area to be trimmed, click on the Edit menu and then click on Cut.

  
  


**Copy Video** : To copy a video selection, you first select the area to be copied using the sliders, and then click on Copy in the Edit menu.  
  
  
  
**Paste Video** : Once you have copied video, you can then paste it into a new video player, or splice it into a current video file.  
  
  
  
To paste video into a new video player window, click on New Player in the file menu and then click on Paste in the Edit menu. This creates an entirely new player that contains only the video that was copied.

  
  


Joining (or splicing video) is done the same way except, you need to open the video that you would like to join the new video with. To determine where the video will be pasted, let the video play until it gets to the point where you want the video to be inserted and then stop the video. Once you stop the video, you can then paste the copied video by going to the Edit menu and clicking on Paste.

  
  


**Add a Soundtrack** : The process for editing video and audio in Quicktime is the same. Being able to add audio allows you to add sound tracks to your video files, easily. Open your music file (mp3, AIFF, etc) in Quicktime and then copy the music the same way you would video. Next, open the video file that you would like to add the music to and click on Add in the Edit Menu. This will add a music track to your video file. If you use Paste instead of Add, the music will be placed in front of or behind the video file. You must use Add to have the audio play in the background of the video file.

  
  


**Apply a Filter** : You can also apply simple filters and special effects to your video using Quicktime. To apply a filter or special effect to your completed video, click on Export in the File Menu. In the Export window, select Movie To Quicktime Movie (*image 3*) and click on the Options button (*obscured by the settings window in image 3*). This will bring up the Settings window.

Next, click on the Filter button (*image 4*). This will allow you to apply various special effects and filters. Click on the arrows (*image 5*) to reveal the different filters and effects. A preview of the effect will be shown on the thumbnail in the lower left corner of the window.

Once you have made your adjustments, click on OK and then select Export. Your video will begin to export with the filter or special effect applied.
