[NASCAR][1], the fastest growing sport in America, has long offered exclusive access ![][2]to premium live and on-demand content via its Nextel TrackPass subscription service for PC. That service is now available to users on the Macintosh platform. 

Nextel TrackPass costs $64.95 per year ($5.41 per month) and provides plenty of content that is sure to make any NASCAR fan happy. Features include PitCommand (raceday and qualifying) which allows you to view real-time race information, live in car audio, live leaderboards, video highlights, audio clips, radio broadcasts, and condensed races. Visit the NASCAR.com [About TrackPass][3] page for more information. According to the information on the NASCAR website, this sevice works equally well for dial-up users as it does for broadband users.

With the Daytona 500 this Sunday, this would be a perfect time to test it out with their [14 day free trial][4]. 

System Requirements include: MacOS 10.3, Safari 1.2.3 (Firefox also works), Java 1.4.2 and RealPlayer. A credit card is required for the free trial and will be billed if you do not cancel the free trial within 14 days.
