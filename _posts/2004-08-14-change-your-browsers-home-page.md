The home page is the first page that loads when your browser opens. Most Internet Service Providers (like MSN, Earthlink) set their own web site as the home page by default when you sign up for their service. This can be changed to any page that you would prefer (news, sports, soap opera recap) with a few easy steps.

  
  
1.  Go to the web page that you would like to set as you home page (or have the address handy).   
    *   Click on the Tools Menu.   
        *   Click on Internet Options   
            *   In the Home Page section of the General Tab, click on the Use Current button (if you took my advice and are at the page that you want to set as your home page) or type in the address of the page (ex. - http://www.gbradhopkins.com).   
                *   Click on OK and you are done.
