If you are a Firefox user then this tip is for you. If you don’t know what Firefox is, then check out [this review][1] that I wrote back on November 11, 2004. Forever Geek has posted an excellent “power-user” trick for increasing the speed of Firefox. The tip is for broadband users (cable modem, DSL) and can be completed in under 1 minute. Definitely worth the time. [Make Firefox Faster: Forevergeek.com][2]
