description: Common git commands for pushing content to my Github account
---

I'm writing this down for me. Not you.

These are the steps for commiting new or updated content to my [Github account](https://github.com/firebrandmedia). As I use Git more, hopefully these will become muscle memory and I'll no longer need this document. Until thenâ€¦

After creating or editing a file, run the following commands in the Terminal.

`git status`

`git add .`

`git commit -m 'Commit message here'`

`git push `

That's it. All done.
