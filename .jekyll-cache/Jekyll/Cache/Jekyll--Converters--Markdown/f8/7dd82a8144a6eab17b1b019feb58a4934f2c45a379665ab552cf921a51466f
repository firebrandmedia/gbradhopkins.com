<p>I love Amazon Prime.<img src="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/upload/2008/03/prime.gif" alt="Amazon Prime" title="Amazon Prime" /></p>

<p>The one drag about shopping online is that there is no instant gratification.Â  You have to wait and wait for your product to arrive (unless itâ€™s a digital download - but weâ€™re talking about physical products here).</p>

<p>With Amazon Prime you get superfast (two day) shipping on most products sold by Amazon.com. And, if two-day shipping doesnâ€™t satisfy that need to have it now - I mean come on, who can wait two whole days? - then for a mere $3.99 per item you can have it even quicker (One Day - Overnight).Â  $3.99. How can you beat that?</p>

<p>Why am I so effusive in my praise of Amazon Prime? Iâ€™ve had it for a couple years but it really hit me last night when I was placing an order for the office.Â  I ordered an iMac, Epson Photo Scanner and an Adobe CS3 Upgrade. The primary reason that I ordered from Amazon was a) the cheap - free - shipping and b) lack of tax.Â  As I got to the final step of the checkout I decided to see how much it would be for next day shipping (to have these items on Monday).Â  I expected it to be significant since I was after all having a computer (heavy) and scanner (large) shipped.Â  But, low and behold it was only $11.00 more! I was amazed.Â  I guess I shouldnâ€™t have been - had I actually read the Amazon Prime details I would have been aware of the minimal cost to overnight these items.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the catch? Well, there is an annual fee of $79.00 for the Amazon Prime membership but if you do a lot of shopping at Amazon.com then you will more than make up for it over the course of a year - plus youâ€™re one step closer to Instant Gratification.Â </p>
