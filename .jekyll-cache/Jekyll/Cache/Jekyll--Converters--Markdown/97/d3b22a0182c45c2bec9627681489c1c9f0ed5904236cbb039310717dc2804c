I"¥<p>In what would be considered a DrudgeReport-type moment, I have received exclusive proof that the election ballots that will be used in the upcoming Nov. 2 election contain flaws that are likely to confuse voters.</p>

<p>Most will remember the confusion created by the <a href="http://www.stcsig.org/usability/topics/ballot/large_ballot_ap.jpg">Florida butterfly ballots</a> in the 2000 presidential election. We are likely to see a repeat of the voter disenfranchisement that occurred in 2000 due to the confusing stands taken by the 2004 Democratic candidate for President. It is speculated that many voters will unknowingly vote for the ‚ÄúAnti-War‚Äù candidate from Massachusetts when they actually meant to vote for the ‚ÄúWar Hero‚Äù from the state of Massachusetts. <em>Developing‚Ä¶</em></p>
