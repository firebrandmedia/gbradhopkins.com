I"C<p>I recently spotlighted some tools from Google that you may not have heard of (<a href="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/2005/01/the_best_google.html">The Best Google Tools You’ve Never Used</a>). Well, the guys at Google are at it again. Google will now provide 4 day weather forcasts through a simple search.</p>

<p>To use this new tool, simply type in the following; “weather zip code” or “weather city, state” (“weather 26505” or “weather morgantown, wv”. Once you hit the search button, you’ll get current coditions and a 4 day forcast.</p>

<p>The search must be done as a phrase search, meaning you have to have it in quotation marks.</p>

<p>This is a nice way to quickly find out the weather in various cities, without having to deal with the increasing ads that are on sites like weather.com.</p>
