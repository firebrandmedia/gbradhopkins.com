I"ù<p>For those who use iTunes as their jukebox (and if you donâ€™t then you seriously need to check it out - <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/jukebox.html">here</a>) there is a free sampler album that is available for download. The album, entitled <strong>iTunes New Music Sampler (Atlantic/Lava Edition)</strong> contains 16 songs from various artists, none of which Iâ€™ve ever heard of. But with creative names like Death Cab for Cutie, Louis XIV and Porcupine Tree, you know it has to be good.</p>
