I"c<p>Now that Tiger [<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS 10.4</a>] is in the wild, the new version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">QuickTime</a> is also <img src="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/images/mac/QuickTime/quicktime-logo.gif" alt="" />available. QuickTime 7, currently only available on the Macintosh, offers a host of new features including the ability to view (and create with the Pro version) beautiful high definition video using the new H.264 codec.</p>

<p>For all those getting ready to upgrade, be warned… (that’s called a tease)</p>

<p>If you currently have the Pro Version of QuickTime 6, you will need to purchase a new registration key to enable QuickTime Pro 7. As someone who rarely reads the warnings when updating software from the Software Update window, this came to a shock to me. I was completely oblivious to the fact until I tried to unlock Pro features of 7 using my version 6 key. Apparently, there were warnings that this would be the case but I missed them. If you find yourself in the same predicament, then you have two choices; (1) Purchase a new key or (2) Reinstall QuickTime 6 using this <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652reinstallerformac.html">6.5.2 reinstaller</a> which removes QuickTime 7.</p>

<p>The major update to the free QuickTime 7 Player is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/technologies/h264/">H.264 codec</a> which allows you to view HD content. Apple has provided an <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/">HD gallery</a> to demonstrate the capabilities of the new codec. These samples are visual feasts, but be warned, they are HUGE!</p>

<p>In addition to the new codec, the QuickTime logo/icon has changed slightly. See image below for before and after images.</p>
