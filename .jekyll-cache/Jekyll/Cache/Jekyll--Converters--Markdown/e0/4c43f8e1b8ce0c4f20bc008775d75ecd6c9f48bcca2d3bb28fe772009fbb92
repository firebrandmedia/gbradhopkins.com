I"Z<p>For those that missed the ads from this years Super Bowl, you can <a href="http://dyn.ifilm.com/superbowlads/"><img src="http://dyn.ifilm.com/superbowlads/" alt="" /></a>watch them all (and the ones that didn’t make the cut) at <a href="http://dyn.ifilm.com/superbowlads/">IFILM.com - Super Bowl Ads</a>. Even if you did see all of the ads, you’ll want to check out the Budweiser ad entitled “Wardrobe Malfunction” for a look into what really happened at last years Super Bowl.</p>

<p>While we’re at it, here are my top 5 Super Bowl XXIX Ads.</p>

<ol>
  <li>FedEx - Dancing Burt</li>
  <li>Diet Pepsi - P.Diddy Truck Trends</li>
  <li>Ameriquest - Taser Scare</li>
  <li>Career Builder - Kissing Monkey Butt</li>
  <li>Ameriquest - Cat Killer</li>
</ol>

<p>Although I liked the Ameriquest commercials, in retrospect they seem derivative of the Southwest Airlines “Wanna get away” commercials.</p>

<p>For an interesting look at the creation of the CareerBuilder.com “Monkey” ads, check out the USAToday article, <em><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2005-02-07-monkeys-usat_x.htm">You just can’t go wrong with a chimp</a></em>.  To see how your preferences compared with theirs, see the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2005-ad-meter-results-chart.htm">USAToday Ad Meter</a>.</p>
