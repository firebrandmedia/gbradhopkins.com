I"w<p>Update - 7/03/13 - <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1157590/how_to_rip_dvd_handbrake.html">Macworld decided to one up me and provided their own, in-depth instruction guide on how to rip a DVD with handbrake. They go into a lot more detail than I did. Read mine first, and then, if you still canâ€™t figure it out or need more help, check out their guide.</a></p>
