<p>Wait. Pause. Delay. Patience.</p>

<p>In life, at our jobs, at school, in traffic, we all have to wait. We don’t want to do it when it comes to accessing a web page. “Slow response times and difficult navigation are the most common complaints of Internet users. After waiting past a certain “attention threshold,” users bail out to look for a faster site.” [<a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/1/">Websiteoptimization.com</a>]</p>

<p>How long do you typically wait for a site to load before you abandon it and move on to greener pastures (with faster servers)? Ten seconds? Five? Maybe fifteen, if it’s a trusted site that I am familiar with.</p>

<p>One of the great hurdles that users face when browsing the internet is slow load times for web pages. This is especially true for users with dial-up connections as opposed to those with high speed (cable, DSL) connections.</p>

<p>As a web designer, what should your goal be when developing a page? How fast should it load? According to <a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/1/">Weboptimzation.com</a>, a web site should load in under 8.6 seconds. Does your web site meet this standard?</p>
