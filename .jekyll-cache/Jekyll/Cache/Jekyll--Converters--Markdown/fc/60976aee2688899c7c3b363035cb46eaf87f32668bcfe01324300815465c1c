I"<p>Apple released an update to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto 5</a> today [version 5.01] which solves some issues <img src="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/images/mac/iPhoto/iPhoto-logo.gif" alt="" />that some users were having (me included). According to the release notes, the update “addresses issues with upgrading iPhoto 4 libraries, dragging albums into folders, importing MPEG 4 movies, and also includes a number of other minor fixes.” The update is available via the software update menu, in most cases. In some cases, it’s not recognizing the new update is available. None of my computers showed the update as being available. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to solve this minor problem and get the newest version of iPhoto.</p>
