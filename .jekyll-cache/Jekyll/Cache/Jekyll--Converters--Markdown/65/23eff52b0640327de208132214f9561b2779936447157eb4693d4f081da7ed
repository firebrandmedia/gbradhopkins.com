I"†<p>Iâ€™ve been a dedicated user of running products in the Nike ecosystem since the original launch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike%2B">Nike+</a> back in May of 2006. In that time, Iâ€™ve logged over 4400 miles using various devices, including the Nike+ iPod, Nike+ Smartwatch and now, the Nike Run Club app. Itâ€™s safe to say that Iâ€™m committed to Nike products.</p>
