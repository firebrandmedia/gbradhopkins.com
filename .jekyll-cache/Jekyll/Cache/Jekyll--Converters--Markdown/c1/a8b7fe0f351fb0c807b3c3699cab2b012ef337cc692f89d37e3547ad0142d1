<p>My best friend from high school, and fellow Orioles fan, recently turned me on to a new way to get Major League Baseball (MLB) content via the AOL Instant Messenger client (or iChat for Mac users).</p>

<p>In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll show you how to access this same content.</p>

<p>To access the content add MLB to your buddy list (AIM name: mlb). As you can see, Iâ€™ve added the MLB logo (which I found via the <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=mlb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">Google.com image search</a>) and <em>Major League Baseball</em> to the name fields.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve added MLB to your buddy list, initiate a chat and type <strong>main</strong>. Typing main will bring up a menu of options including <strong>1-Alerts &amp; Live Polls</strong>, <strong>2-Standings</strong>, <strong>3-Headlines</strong>, <strong>4-Fantasy Games</strong>, <strong>5-MLB Multimedia</strong>, <strong>6-Team Info</strong>, <strong>7-Statistics</strong>, <strong>8-Schedule</strong> and <strong>9-Tickets</strong>. Accessing content is then as simple as typing the number of the option that you would like to access and hitting enter. Below I have added a transcript of a chat session that I had recently with MLB.com.Â  Most of the content links to a website (either the individual team or to MLB.com) so you will need your web browser.</p>
