I"€<p><img src="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/upload/2007/10/leopard.jpg" alt="" />I received my copy of MacOS 10.5 â€˜Leopardâ€™ yesterday via FedEx and promptly installed it on 3 of 5 computers that I have at home and in the office (a PowerBook G4, iMac (Intel) and a PowerMac Dual Processor G5).Â  I also began an install on an iMac G5 which failed on the first installation attempt (and is currently in the process of installing - 2nd attempt). I thought Iâ€™d share my impressions of the new OS X (one - because I want to get in the habit of writing more and two - because I was hoping to get some feedback from other users).</p>
