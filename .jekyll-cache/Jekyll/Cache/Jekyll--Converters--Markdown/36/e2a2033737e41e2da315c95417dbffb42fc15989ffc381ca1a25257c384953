I"ä<p>Generally speaking, getting in shape is a selfish endeavor. We usually try to get in shape because we want to look better or feel better about ourselves. I mean, we could say weâ€™re doing it for our kids or for our loved ones but if weâ€™re honest, itâ€™s mostly about self-image. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything inherently wrong with that, although we can become obsessed with it and let vanity rule our lives, but letâ€™s just assume that weâ€™re not taking it that far.</p>
