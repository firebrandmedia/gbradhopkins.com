It is well worth checking out.</p>

<p>In this short entry I‚Äôll give you a look at some of the screenshots from my gBradhopkins.com sitemap account.</p>

<p><strong>What is Google Sitemaps?</strong></p>

<p>From the Google Sitemaps Help File: ‚Äú*Google Sitemaps is an easy way for you to help improve your coverage in the Google index. It‚Äôs a collaborative crawling system that enables you to communicate directly with Google to keep us informed of all your web pages, and when you make changes to these pages.&lt;/p&gt; 
With Google Sitemaps you get:</p>

<p>Better crawl coverage to help people find more of your web pages.<br />
Fresher search results.<br />
A smarter crawl because you can provide specific information about all your web pages, such as when a page was last modified or how frequently a page change.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots from my Google Sitemaps account.</p>

<p>This is a view of the Google Sitemaps Overview screen. This gives you a look at all of the sitemaps that you‚Äôve added, whether they have been verified or not and whether or not they have errors.</p>

<p>Google Sitemap Index Stats shows you how your site is indexed in the Google search engine (sites similar to yours, sites that link to yours, the current cache of your page in the index, etc.).</p>

<p>Google Sitemaps Errors shows which pages they tried to crawl (found either through links from your Sitemaps or from other pages) but couldn‚Äôt access and gives a description of the error and possibly how to fix it.</p>

<p>While the Sitemaps project purports to have no bearing on your search engine placement (or rank), it sure can‚Äôt hurt.</p>
