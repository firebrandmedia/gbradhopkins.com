I"O<p>MacDesign Magazine, one of the best you’ll find for tips, tricks and tutorials on <img src="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/images/webdesign/layersmag/logo.gif" alt="" />the applications that are near and dear to the heart (and wallet) of every web developer, graphic designer and video editor has changed names and focus (slightly).</p>

<p>It will now be called Layers Magazine, and it will primarily focus on Adobe applications. While this is not a huge change of course, it will mean that Final Cut Pro is no longer a feature in the magazine (although it will continue to be a focus on the <a href="http://macdesignonline.com/">MacDesign website</a>).</p>

<p>For those of you who use Flash and Dreamweaver, both applications from Macromedia, you have nothing to worry about now that Adobe has made a bid to buy Macromedia.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.layersmagazine.com">Layers Magazine website</a> has a plethora of information for the Graphic Design professional. You’ll find how-to’s, video demonstrations, training DVDs and articles about your favorite apps (Photoshop, Illustrator, GoLive, InDesign, Acrobat, Flash and Dreamweaver).</p>
