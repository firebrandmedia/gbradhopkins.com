I"»<p>The great thing about the internet is that if you have a problem, you can usually find a solution to that problem.Â  The problem I had was that my wife got a new Motorola V365 cell phone and we needed to transfer all of her contacts to the new phone and I thought iSync (via Bluetooth) would be the easiest way to do it. WRONG!</p>

<p>iSync would not recognize the V365 (actually, it did recognize it - it just wouldnâ€™t support it).</p>
