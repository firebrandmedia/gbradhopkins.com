I"¡<p>Generally speaking, getting in shape is a selfish endeavor. We usually try to get in shape because we want to look better or feel better about ourselves. I mean, we could say we‚Äôre doing it for our kids or for our loved ones but if we‚Äôre honest, it‚Äôs mostly about self-image. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything inherently wrong with that, although we can become obsessed with it and let vanity rule our lives, but let‚Äôs just assume that we‚Äôre not taking it that far.</p>

<p>What if, in addition to trying to get in shape for our own selfish reasons, we could also help someone in need? That‚Äôs the concept behind <a href="http://www.charitymiles.org/">Charity Miles</a>. Charity Miles allows you to earn money for charity when you walk, run, or bike.</p>

<p>I first heard about Charity Miles at South by Southwest. I participated in the daily Brooks Cowboy Run and someone handed me a postcard on my way back to my hotel following a run. If you‚Äôve ever been to SxSW before, then you know that you are inundated with people trying to get you to check out their new app, product or service. So, I stuffed the postcard in my bag when I got back to my hotel and forgot about it. Last week, I was cleaning out my bag in preparation for a meeting and I found the postcard. I decided to check out Charity Miles, so I downloaded the app and checked out the website.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>From the Charity Miles website: ‚ÄúReady to become a sponsored athlete? Simply turn on the app, choose a charity, and press start. As you exercise, we‚Äôll track your distance and the money earned. When you‚Äôre finished, accept your sponsorship, spread the word, and we‚Äôll send you a note confirming your good work. It‚Äôs as easy as this: get moving. Bikers earn 10¬¢ a mile and walkers and runners earn 25¬¢ a mile, up to our initial $1,000,000 sponsorship pool.‚Äù</p>

<p>As a dedicated Nike+ user, my typical running routine is to either use the Nike+ app on my phone or use the Nike+ app on my iPod touch in conjunction with the Zombies, Run! app. So, instead of using the Nike+ app or the Zombies, Run! app, I have started to use the Charity Miles app in conjunction with my iPod touch. (I‚Äôve got to keep logging those Nike+ miles!)</p>

<p>So far, my experience with the Charity Miles app has been pretty good, although, the first time I used it it crashed and I lost my run. Not a good way to start - especially since it was a 4 mile run. Since that first experience, the app has been solid and I‚Äôve been able to see the value in using the app as a way to help charitable organizations without any extra effort on my part.</p>

<p>Current organizations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VisionSpring</li>
  <li>every mother counts</li>
  <li>Feeding America</li>
  <li>Autism Speaks</li>
  <li>Wounded Warrior Project</li>
  <li>Stand Up To Cancer</li>
  <li>Achilles International</li>
  <li>The Michael J. Fox Foundation</li>
  <li>Red</li>
  <li>World Food Programme</li>
  <li>The Nature Conservancy</li>
  <li>ASPCA</li>
  <li>Habitat for Humanity</li>
  <li>Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</li>
  <li>Partnership for a Healthier America</li>
  <li>Pencils of Promise</li>
  <li>Girl Up</li>
  <li>Shot @ Life</li>
  <li>NothingButNets.net</li>
  <li>IronMan Foundation</li>
  <li>DoSomething.org</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, whether you want to help out here in the US or internationally, there are plenty of charities to choose from.</p>

<p>For me, the best feature is the ability to see the direct impact of each run, walk or bike. In addition to showing how long or how far you ran, there is an impact screen that shows the direct impact of your workout. For example, my 2.361 mile run with Feeding America selected as the charity accounted for 4.72 meals to hungry people while my 1.775 mile run with Habitat for Humanity as the selected charity accounted for 4.44 pieces of lumber.</p>

<p>At the end of each run, you also have the chance to share your run via Twitter or Facebook, sharing your run with not only your friends, but also the organization that you supported.</p>

So, are you looking for a little extra motivation? Tired of running from zombies? I‚Äôd recommend giving the <a href="http://www.charitymiles.org/">Charity Miles</a> app a try. It‚Äôs available for iOS and Android.</p>
