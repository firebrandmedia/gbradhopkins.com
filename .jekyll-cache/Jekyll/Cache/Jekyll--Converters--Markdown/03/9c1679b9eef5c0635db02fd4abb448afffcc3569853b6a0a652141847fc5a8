I"7<p>If you are a Firefox user then this tip is for you. If you don’t know what Firefox is, then check out <a href="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/2004/11/firefox_10_the.html">this review</a> that I wrote back on November 11, 2004. Forever Geek has posted an excellent “power-user” trick for increasing the speed of Firefox. The tip is for broadband users (cable modem, DSL) and can be completed in under 1 minute. Definitely worth the time. <a href="http://forevergeek.com/open_source/make_firefox_faster.php">Make Firefox Faster: Forevergeek.com</a></p>
