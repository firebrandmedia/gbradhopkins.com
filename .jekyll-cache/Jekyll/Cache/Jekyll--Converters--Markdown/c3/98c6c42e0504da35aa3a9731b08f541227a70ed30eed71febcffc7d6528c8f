I"Ü<p>After a long period of inactivity (ie, not publishing anything here on gbradhopkins.com) I felt the urge to post and when I tried to rebuild my site, I received the following error.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dependency Error: Yikes! It looks like you donâ€™t have jekyll-paginate or one of its dependencies installed. In order to use Jekyll as currently configured, youâ€™ll need to install this gem. The full error message from Ruby is: â€˜cannot load such file â€“ jekyll-paginateâ€™ If you run into trouble, you can find helpful resources at https://jekyllrb.com/help/!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A quick <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=you+don%27t+have+jekyll-paginate&amp;ia=web">search</a> will lead you to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35401566/dont-have-jekyll-paginate-or-one-of-its-dependencies-installed">StackOverflow</a>.</p>

<p>There, you will find various solutions. The one that worked for me was to simply run the following command to install the Jekyll Paginate gem.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem install jekyll-paginate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Actually, I had to add sudo to the front of the command and supply my password to install it. So, it looked like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo gem install jekyll-paginate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once I did that, I was able to rebuild my site and push it to Github.</p>
