I"j<p>For those who use iTunes as their jukebox (and if you don’t then you seriously need to check it out - <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/jukebox.html">here</a>) there is a free sampler album that is available for download. The album, entitled <strong>iTunes New Music Sampler (Atlantic/Lava Edition)</strong> contains 16 songs from various artists, none of which I’ve ever heard of. But with creative names like Death Cab for Cutie, Louis XIV and Porcupine Tree, you know it has to be good.</p>

<p>Clicking will launch iTunes where you can download individual tracks or the entire album.</p>

<p>Speaking of online music, The Washington Post’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18496-2005Feb12.html"><strong>Rob Pegararo has a review of Napster’s new Napster To Go</strong></a> service that was advertised during the Super Bowl. Worth a read if you are trying to decide on a music download service.</p>

<p>One last ‘Speaking of…’</p>

<p>Speaking of music, I saw Switchfoot in concert on Friday Night (2/11) and I must say that they exceeded expectations (which were pretty high anyway). If you haven’t given them a listen then be sure to look them up on your favorite music service or online at <a href="http://www.switchfoot.com"><strong>switchfoot.com</strong></a>. Make sure you turn you speakers down when you visit switchfoot.com. They have a music track that plays that can surprise you if you aren’t expecting it.</p>
