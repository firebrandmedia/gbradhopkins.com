I"M	<p>Am I a sucker, or what? I was excited when I read on MacMinute [<a href="http://www.macminute.com/2004/10/05/virtualpc7/">full story</a>] that Virtual PC 7 <img src="http://gbradhopkins.com/images/mac/VPC7/icon.gif" alt="" />was going to be immediately available. Then I called to check the status of my order…</p>

<p>I ordered the Microsoft Office X Professional suite back in June, when Microsoft initiated their Tech Guarantee promotion. This would allow those that purchased the suite to receive a free upgrade, to Office 2004 Professional when the new product came out. As we all know, there was a slight (ahem) delay in the release of the product, and then a slight delay in the release of the Virtual PC. No biggie. I have Virtual PC 6 on my TiBook and only use it when teaching an intro to PC class that I teach at the local tech center. All in all, I wasn’t losing sleep over it. I just wanted to be able to run it on my G5 with hopefully more speed than that of VPC 6 on my G4 TiBook.</p>

<p>Finally, yesteday I saw the words I was waiting for “Virtual PC now available.” So, I decided to call Microsoft to check my order. When I called in, the first person I spoke with asked me if Microsoft could call me back to question me about my customer service experience. I said “No.” Why do I want Microsoft calling me? What complaints could I possibly have? Besides, the less I have to deal with Microsoft, the better. But I digress.</p>

<p>Next, I was transferred to my Customer Service Representative, who told me that I would not get my order for 4 - 6 weeks! That’s when the cheese fell out of my sandwich. He said it was on a first order, first serve basis.</p>

<p>This lead me to draw some conclusions, all or some of which may be true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Now available means “We’ve given up on this piece of junk so let’s send it to the printer”</li>
  <li>Microsoft is at full capacity, copying them on their spanking new Dell desktop with DVD burner, and can only send out 5 per day (6 if they stay up late).</li>
  <li>I am a sucker, for expecting any Microsoft product to ship in a timely (same calendar year) fashion.</li>
  <li>Tech Guarantees are probably at the end of the line and will be shipped last</li>
</ul>

<p>By the time it ships, it should have Longhorn installed. Oh wait, that’s not “due” until 2006.</p>
