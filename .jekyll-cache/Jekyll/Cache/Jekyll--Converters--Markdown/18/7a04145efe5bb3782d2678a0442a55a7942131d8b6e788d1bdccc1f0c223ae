I"ı<p>Need a quick way to toggle between tabs in Safari (or, pretty much any other browser) using keyboard shortcuts?</p>

<p><img src="/images/tabs.JPG" alt="Safari Tabs" /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m a big fan of keyboard shortcuts - anything that keeps my hands on the keyboard makes me happy, and more efficient - so when a friend asked if there was a way to toggle between open tabs I thought, â€œWhy didnâ€™t I think of that?â€</p>

<p>I often have between 5 and 10 browser tabs open at a time and switching between them using using the touchpad is decidedly inefficient.</p>

<p>As it turns out, of course there is.</p>

<p><strong>Toggle Forward</strong></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Command - Shift - ]</code></p>

<p><strong>Toggle Backward</strong></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Command - Shift - [</code></p>

<p>This keyboard combination also works in Firefox and Chrome as well.</p>
