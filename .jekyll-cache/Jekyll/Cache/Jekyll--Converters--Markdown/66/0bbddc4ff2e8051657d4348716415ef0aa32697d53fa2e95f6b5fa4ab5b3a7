I"Â<p>With the release of iTunes 4 and the integrated iTunes Music Store (iTMS) Apple has added the ability to view album artwork. Every song that you purchase comes with the album artwork for the album that it comes from. This is great for newly purchased music, but what about CDâ€™s that youâ€™ve ripped? Or music that youâ€™ve downloaded (legally, of course) off of the internet? Iâ€™ll show you how to find the album art for all of your music.</p>
