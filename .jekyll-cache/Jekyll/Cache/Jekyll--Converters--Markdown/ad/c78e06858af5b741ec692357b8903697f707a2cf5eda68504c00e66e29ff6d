I"<p>Yesterday I wrote an article about my <a href="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/2007/10/macos_105_leopa.html" title="First Impressions of MacOS 10.5 Leopard">first impressions of MacOS 10.5 ‘Leopard’</a>. Today, I have a slightly different perspective as for the first time ever, I’ve had a failure when installing a version of MacOS X. <br />
In this article I’ll provide a way for you to (hopefully) recover the files that are on your system in the event that the same thing happens to you. </p>
