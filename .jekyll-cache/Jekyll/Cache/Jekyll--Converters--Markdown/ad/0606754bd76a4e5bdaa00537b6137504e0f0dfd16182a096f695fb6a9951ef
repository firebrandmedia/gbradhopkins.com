I"Ò<p>In a previous tutorial (<a href="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/2004/11/citibank_phishe_1.html">Citibank Phisher Scheme</a>) I talked about spoof emails and <img src="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/images/internet/ebay/ebay-logo.gif" alt="" />phisher schemes and what you could do to avoid them. This morning (March 12, 2005) I fell for an eBay related phisher scheme. As you can probably imagine I started to panic the minute I realized what I had done.</p>
