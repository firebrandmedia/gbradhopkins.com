I"W<p>I’m a big fan of and use it on most all of the sites that I build.  I recently installed a <a href="http://www.google.com/sitesearch/">Google Custom Search Engine (CSE)</a> to a <a href="http://www.inthepanhandle.com/">site</a> of mine and was hoping to use Google Analytics to track the searches that were performed on the site in the Google CSE.</p>

<p>The problem is that after a couple days, there were still no results.  It was off to the Google CSE Discussion Group to search for the answer - and I found it.</p>

<p>By the way, the Google CSE Discussion Group seems to not be monitored by anyone at Google or if it is, it’s not a priority to respond to queries.  But there are still answers to be found from fellow users.</p>

<p>The answer I found was to edit the Profile Settings in Google Analytics for the site in question.  Now, I’m going to assume that you’ve set <strong>Site Search</strong> to ‘Do Track Site Search.’  If you haven’t, do that.  Next, you need to add a Query Parameter to the parameters that are already in place (term,search,query).  The query parameter that you want to add is ‘q’ (see image). Now hit ‘Save Changes.’</p>

<p>That’s it.  Now, just wait for the results to be displayed in Google Analytics.</p>
