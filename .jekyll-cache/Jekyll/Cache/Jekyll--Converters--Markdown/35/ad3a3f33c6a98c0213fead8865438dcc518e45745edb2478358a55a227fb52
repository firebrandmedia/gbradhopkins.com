I"Ã<p>For Christmas this year (2019), I wanted to make and print a FIFA20 FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) card for my kids. Both play rec-league soccer and I thought it would be a fun gift for the both of them. I saw the photo of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dtexf9/vardy_is_premiere_league_player_of_the_month_will/">Jamie Vardy with his Premier League Player of the Month card</a> and wanted to model it after something like that.</p>
