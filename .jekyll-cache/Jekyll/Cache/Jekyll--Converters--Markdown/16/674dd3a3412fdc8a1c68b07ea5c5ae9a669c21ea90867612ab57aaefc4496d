I";<p>Okay, so maybe horror story is a bit much. But, maybe not. Apple released an update to MacOS X Panther yesterday (<a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosxupdate1038.html">10.3.8 - found here</a>) and as usual, I installed it without hesitation. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s where things went awry.</p>
