I"X<p>Someone recently asked me how to add a ‘Set as Homepage’ link to their website. If you are unfamiliar with these types of links, they are links which you can click on to set the current page as your homepage. It simplifies the process for changing the homepage (see previous tutorial on <a href="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/2004/08/change_your_bro.html" title="Set Homepage in Internet Explorer">setting homepage in Internet Explorer</a>) that you have set in your browser. In this tutorial for website designers I’ll show you how you can add a link like this to your website.</p>
