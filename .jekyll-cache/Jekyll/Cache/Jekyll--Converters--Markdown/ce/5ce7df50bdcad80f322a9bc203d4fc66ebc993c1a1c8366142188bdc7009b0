I"™	<p>Iâ€™ve been a dedicated user of running products in the Nike ecosystem since the original launch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike%2B">Nike+</a> back in May of 2006. In that time, Iâ€™ve logged over 4400 miles using various devices, including the Nike+ iPod, Nike+ Smartwatch and now, the Nike Run Club app. Itâ€™s safe to say that Iâ€™m committed to Nike products.</p>

<p>On June 11, 2013 I ordered a <a href="https://amzn.to/2rrkcPW">Nike+ SportWatch GPS Powered by TomTom ($168.27)</a>. This was around the time that smartwatches were starting to come on the market. I remember wearing my sportwatch to my sonâ€™s field day and being asked if it was a smartwatch.</p>

<p>Initially, I used the Nike+ Sportwatch almost exclusively but, after a bad experience in which a number of runs were not synchronized properly, I began to use the watch less frequently. I still used it on occassion, primarily when I wanted to get out and run without my phone (or, when the phone didnâ€™t have a sufficient charge).</p>

<p>On April 16, 2018, I received the following email from Nike:</p>

<p>The watch still works. You can tell time with it and track your runs, but theyâ€™ll no longer synchronize with your Nike account.</p>

<p>I guess we call this progress.</p>
