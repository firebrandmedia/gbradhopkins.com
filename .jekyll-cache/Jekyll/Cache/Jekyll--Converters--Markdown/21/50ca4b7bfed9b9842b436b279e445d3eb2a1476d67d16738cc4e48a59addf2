I"X<p>I’m a big fan of Flickr. Or, at least I was. If I had to describe our relationship I would describe it as complicated. I’m not a huge fan of the new layout but I can live with it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Flickr-Bar.jpg" alt="Yahoo! Universal Header" /></p>

<p>What I can’t live with is the new Yahoo! toolbar that I’m seeing on one of my Flickr accounts - highlighted in red in the image above. This is a premium account. I paid for it. Even when the distinguishing features - namely, lots of space - were added to the standard account, I didn’t downgrade it.</p>

<p>Another feature of a premium account was the fact that there are no ads. I consider this an ad. It’s not adding to my experience. It’s pushing other Yahoo! services and links. I don’t need that.</p>

<p>So far, I’m only seeing this on one of my accounts so I’ll monitor it and see where it goes. Needless to say, I don’t like the direction that it’s heading.</p>
