description: I would love to switch from Evernote to DS Note but there is one reason why I cant.
---

I'm a big fan of Evernote. So much so that in [a previous article on my business blog](http://firebrand.media/blog/article/why_i_write_in_evernote), I outlined the reasons that I thought Evernote was the best software for writing (among other things).

But, Evernote has made some changes (as software companies are want to do), the most concerning of which is the [migration of data to the Google Cloud Platform](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/226885427-FAQ-About-Migration-to-Google-Cloud-Platform), which began in October. 

Additionally, I've set a goal to move as much of my data as possible, out of the hands of companies and into my own hands. Why would I set this as a goal? My primary reason is that I would like to no longer provide money or data to tech companies - especially when I have an alternative solution.

As always, the question is, does the alternative solution have a practical workflow and / or, have I become so reliant on the current service - in this case Evernote - that it is impracticle to change the way I work.

##DS Note

The alternative solution that I have available is DS Note, a package of the [Synology DiskStation](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/6.0/features) that is installed on the [ioSafe](https://iosafe.com/products-216nas-overview) Network Attached Server (NAS) that I have. The ioSafe is a water _and_ fire proof NAS. Primarily, I've been using it to automatically back up photos from my phones (both iOS and Android) using the DS Photo package. To a lesser extent, I am also using it to store files, a la Dropbox, using the Cloudstation package.
