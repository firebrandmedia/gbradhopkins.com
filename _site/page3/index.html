In this article I’ll provide a way for you to (hopefully) recover the files that are on your system in the event that the same thing happens to you.

            <span class="post-meta"><img src="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/upload/2007/10/leopard.jpg" alt="" />I received my copy of MacOS 10.5 ‘Leopard’ yesterday via FedEx and promptly installed it on 3 of 5 computers that I have at home and in the office (a PowerBook G4, iMac (Intel) and a PowerMac Dual Processor G5).  I also began an install on an iMac G5 which failed on the first installation attempt (and is currently in the process of installing - 2nd attempt). I thought I’d share my impressions of the new OS X (one - because I want to get in the habit of writing more and two - because I was hoping to get some feedback from other users).

            <span class="post-meta">The great thing about the internet is that if you have a problem, you can usually find a solution to that problem.  The problem I had was that my wife got a new Motorola V365 cell phone and we needed to transfer all of her contacts to the new phone and I thought iSync (via Bluetooth) would be the easiest way to do it. WRONG!

iSync would not recognize the V365 (actually, it did recognize it - it just wouldn’t support it).

            <span class="post-meta">Someone recently asked me how to add a ‘Set as Homepage’ link to their website. If you are unfamiliar with these types of links, they are links which you can click on to set the current page as your homepage. It simplifies the process for changing the homepage (see previous tutorial on <a href="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/2004/08/change_your_bro.html" title="Set Homepage in Internet Explorer">setting homepage in Internet Explorer</a>) that you have set in your browser. In this tutorial for website designers I’ll show you how you can add a link like this to your website.

            <span class="post-meta"><img src="http://www.gbradhopkins.com/archives/seo-wednesday.gif" alt="seo-wednesday.gif" />In the fourth entry of SEO Wednesday, we will look at researching the keywords that our target audience would use when searching. By knowing the keywords that our audience will use when they search, we can generate content for those keywords, making our site more relevant, hopefully moving it one step closer to the top of the SERP (search engine results page).
