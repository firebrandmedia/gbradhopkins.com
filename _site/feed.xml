        <title>Internet Privacy Links, Updated</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on April 30, 2013, I have updated this article and will continue to update it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet privacy and the way companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter use our data has been on my mind recently. Here are a collection of links related to those topics. At some point, I’m going to pull it all together and express my feelings on this important topic. For the time being, these are as much for me as they are for anyone finding them here on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More Git Commands</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous entry, I wrote about my use of Git and how I preferred to use a Git client (Tower) as opposed to the command line. In that entry, I listed some &lt;a href=&quot;http://gbradhopkins.com/web/design/tutorials/2016/09/29/git-commit-workflow.html&quot;&gt;basic Git commands&lt;/a&gt;. These were the basic commands that I needed to push content to the repository for this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve been transitioning to the command line for more and more of my commits. I recently picked up the so-far, excellent book by David Demaree, &lt;a href=&quot;https://abookapart.com/products/git-for-humans&quot;&gt;Git for Humans&lt;/a&gt; from A Book Apart. In this book, I’ve started to add some commands to my toolbox. I have decided to list the new commands that I am using, here, as much as a resource for myself, as anything else. Personally, I find that I run a few commands frequently but then forget some of the less used commands. This will be my go-to reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re using the command line, these commands may not necessarily be specific to Git, but can be used with Git. If you are looking for tutorials on Git, check out the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git&quot;&gt;Git tutorials from Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;git-commands&quot;&gt;Git Commands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creates a new directory or folder within the directory that you are already in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exmas and Crissmas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;And beyond this there lies in the ocean, turned towards the west and north, the island of Niatirb which Hecataeus indeed declares to be the same size and shape as Sicily, but it is larger, though in calling it triangular a man would not miss the mark. It is densely inhabited by men who wear clothes not very different from the other barbarians who occupy the north western parts of Europe though they do not agree with them in language. These islanders, surpassing all the men of whom we know in patience and endurance, use the following customs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of winter when fogs and rains most abound they have a great festival which they call Exmas and for fifty days they prepare for it in the fashion I shall describe. First of all, every citizen is obliged to send to each of his friends and relations a square piece of hard paper stamped with a picture, which in their speech is called an Exmas-card. But the pictures represent birds sitting on branches, or trees with a dark green prickly leaf, or else men in such garments as the Niatirbians believe that their ancestors wore two hundred years ago riding in coaches such as their ancestors used, or houses with snow on their roofs. And the Niatirbians are unwilling to say what these pictures have to do with the festival; guarding (as I suppose) some sacred mystery. And because all men must send these cards the marketplace is filled with the crowd of those buying them, so that there is great labour and weariness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But having bought as many as they suppose to be sufficient, they return to their houses and find there the like cards which others have sent to them. And when they find cards from any to whom they also have sent cards, they throw them away and give thanks to the gods that this labour at least is over for another year. But when they find cards from any to whom they have not sent, then they beat their breasts and wail and utter curses against the sender; and, having sufficiently lamented their misfortune, they put on their boots again and go out into the fog and rain and buy a card for him also. And let this account suffice about Exmas-cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also send gifts to one another, suffering the same things about the gifts as about the cards, or even worse. For every citizen has to guess the value of the gift which every friend will send to him so that he may send one of equal value, whether he can afford it or not. And they buy as gifts for one another such things as no man ever bought for himself. For the sellers, understanding the custom, put forth all kinds of trumpery, and whatever, being useless and ridiculous, they have been unable to sell throughout the year they now sell as an Exmas gift. And though the Niatirbians profess themselves to lack sufficient necessary things, such as metal, leather, wood and paper, yet an incredible quantity of these things is wasted every year, being made into the gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But during these fifty days the oldest, poorest, and most miserable of the citizens put on false beards and red robes and walk about the market-place; being disguised (in my opinion) as Cronos. And the sellers of gifts no less than the purchaser’s become pale and weary, because of the crowds and the fog, so that any man who came into a Niatirbian city at this season would think some great public calamity had fallen on Niatirb. This fifty days of preparation is called in their barbarian speech the Exmas Rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when the day of the festival comes, then most of the citizens, being exhausted with the Rush, lie in bed till noon. But in the evening they eat five times as much supper as on other days and, crowning themselves with crowns of paper, they become intoxicated. And on the day after Exmas they are very grave, being internally disordered by the supper and the drinking and reckoning how much they have spent on gifts and on the wine. For wine is so dear among the Niatirbians that a man must swallow the worth of a talent before he is well intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such, then, are their customs about the Exmas. But the few among the Niatirbians have also a festival, separate and to themselves, called Crissmas, which is on the same day as Exmas. And those who keep Crissmas, doing the opposite to the majority of the Niatirbians, rise early on that day with shining faces and go before sunrise to certain temples where they partake of a sacred feast. And in most of the temples they set out images of a fair woman with a new-born Child on her knees and certain animals and shepherds adoring the Child. (The reason of these images is given in a certain sacred story which I know but do not repeat.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I myself conversed with a priest in one of these temples and asked him why they kept Crissmas on the same day as Exmas; for it appeared to me inconvenient. But the priest replied, “It is not lawful, O stranger, for us to change the date of Chrissmas, but would that Zeus would put it into the minds of the Niatirbians to keep Exmas at some other time or not to keep it at all. For Exmas and the Rush distract the minds even of the few from sacred things. And we indeed are glad that men should make merry at Crissmas; but in Exmas there is no merriment left.” And when I asked him why they endured the Rush, he replied, “It is, O Stranger, a racket”; using (as I suppose) the words of some oracle and speaking unintelligibly to me (for a racket is an instrument which the barbarians use in a game called tennis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what Hecataeus says, that Exmas and Crissmas are the same, is not credible. For first, the pictures which are stamped on the Exmas-cards have nothing to do with the sacred story which the priests tell about Crissmas. And secondly, the most part of the Niatirbians, not believing the religion of the few, nevertheless send the gifts and cards and participate in the Rush and drink, wearing paper caps. But it is not likely that men, even being barbarians, should suffer so many and great things in honour of a god they do not believe in. And now, enough about Niatirb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An essay written by C. S. Lewis entitled “Xmas and Christmas: A Lost Chapter from Herodotus.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short story always makes me stop and think about how we have distorted the Christmas season.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Only certain keys working on your Mac keyboard? This may be the solution.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter decided to confound me this afternoon by hitting the option key 5 times on our MacMini. She did this accidentally, and without knowing that she did, but once she did, the keyboard no longer worked in its normal way. Unbeknownst to me, she enabled Mouse Keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-mouse-keys&quot;&gt;What Are Mouse Keys?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mouse Keys allow you to use your keyboard to move your pointer around the screen instead of a mouse or trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When Mouse Keys is enabled with one of these keyboards, you can use the keys 7,8,9, U, I, O, J, K, L, M, and ‘.’ (period) to control movement of the mouse pointer and mouse clicking, but other numbers, letters, and keys cannot be used. (Keyboards with no numeric keypad or Num Lock key include: Apple Wireless Keyboard (2007), the built-in keyboard on MacBook (Late 2007) or newer, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro (Early 2008), or newer.) The following keys will continue to operate normally when Mouse Keys is enabled: Esc, Function keys, Eject, Delete, Tab, Shift, fn, Control, Option, Command, and the arrow keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea such a feature existed and was racking my brain to figure out what the issue was. I restarted several times, disconnected the keyboard (bluetooth), zapped the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063&quot;&gt;NVRAM&lt;/a&gt; and tried various other types of voodoo to no avail. Finally, I stumbled upon an article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/mac-keyboard-not-working-mouse-keys-may-be-activated/&quot;&gt;2009 on CNet&lt;/a&gt; which described my issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enabline--disabling-mouse-keys&quot;&gt;Enabline / Disabling Mouse Keys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have no intention of ever using Mouse Keys, I’d recommend disabling it altogether. Not surprisingly, the option is found under Accessibility, which seems to be a treasure trove of goodies to enhance (or, impair) your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mouse-keys-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Accessibility Menu Screen Capture&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;Accessibility Menu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are in the Accessibility system preference pane, click on ‘Mouse &amp;amp; Trackpad’ to show the check-box for enabling / disabling Mouse Keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mouse-keys-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Mouse &amp;amp; Trackpad Preference Pane Screen Capture&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;Mouse &amp;amp; Trackpad Preference Pane Screen Capture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ticking the checkbox enables Mouse Keys and reneders your keyboard otherwise useless. To set the option for enabling by tapping ‘option’ 5 times, click on the options button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mouse-keys-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Mouse &amp;amp; Trackpad Preference Pane Screen Capture&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;Mouse &amp;amp; Trackpad Preference Pane Screen Capture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit disappointing that they don’t actually indicate the keys to use to move the pointer around the screen. Without the guide of which keys to use, this feature seems less helpful than it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Five Favorite Alternative Browsers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of trying out alternative browsers. In this entry, I’m going to list my five favorite alternative browsers. By alternative, I mean, not Safari, Firefox or Chrome which make up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp&quot;&gt;over 92% of browser usage worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I was committed to Firefox and then I moved away from it in favor of Safari. As a Mac user, I have found iCloud tabs to be invaluable and while Firefox Sync can replicate this feature, it was a bit late to the game for me. By the time it was available and they had released an iOS app to make it available on all of my devices, I had already switched back to Safari. Additionally, I felt like speed became an issue with Firefox. This may have been a result of excessive &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-groups-panorama/&quot;&gt;Tab Group&lt;/a&gt; usage, another feature that I loved on Firefox and probably abused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been a big fan of Chrome but I do find some of the developer plug-ins available compelling - although most are also available on Firefox as well so if they were such a big deal I could use them in Firefox and be pretty satisfied. I also like the Chrome dev tools but not so much so that I would switch to Chrome from Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve outlined my thoughts on Safari, Chrome and Firefox, here are my five favorite alternative browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vivaldi&quot;&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Chromium, I would consider Vivaldi a good general usage web browser. It has some really interesting features and customizations and because it’s based on Chromium, all of the Chrome add-ons work with it. My favorite features are the ability to arrange the tabs wherever you like - top, bottom, side. I also like the adaptive title bar that changes color based on the primary color of the website that you are on. Tab stacks, similar to tab groups in Firefox, are another great feature for organizing tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would consider it more of a general use browser - as opposed to a developer browser - because the dev tools aren’t as fully featured as those found in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.com&quot;&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;min&quot;&gt;Min&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a name like Min, what would you expect? Min doesn’t seem to be made for users of plug-ins, add-ons and developer tools, also known as power users. It’s a fast, minimal browser that has been made using open source software with efficiency and power management in mind. Privacy also seems to be a priority as the default search engine is DuckDuckGo and ads and trackers are blocked by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like Vivaldi, it features an adaptive title bar that changes color based on the primary color of the site that you are visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary use of Min is when I need to take a screenshot of a website without all of the browser chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://minbrowser.github.io/min/&quot;&gt;Min&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fluid-browser&quot;&gt;Fluid Browser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fluid Browser is a totally different concept. It acts as more of a picture-in-picture window for the web. Why would you need a PIP display? Tutorial videos? PDF files? Web media? Fluid acts as a secondary window that can display content while you work in your primary browser or application. I know what you’re thinking, “I can do that anyway. Just pop open a new window and drag it off to the side.” True, but can you adjust the transparency of the window and work through it? I didn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Fluid is great if you are trying to follow along with a tutorial while working in your primary app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fluidbrowser.com&quot;&gt;Fluid Browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tor&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard of Tor even if you don’t know exactly what it is. Tor, based on Mozilla, allows you to browse the web anonymously. You may think, “Wait, can’t I just open a private window in Chrome / Safari / Firefox?” Yes, but that doesn’t necessarily protect your anonymity. Tor protects your anonymity by relaying your requests through their network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the screen capture below, you can see that even using a private window (middle browser window), my IP address and location are readily available. But, by using Tor (bottom window), my IP and location are anonymized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/browser-private-ip-tor.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Screen capture showing anonymized IP address using Tor vs a Private Window&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;Screen capture showing anonymized IP address using Tor vs a Private Window&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&quot;&gt;description on the Tor site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a lot of activities that I want to protect but, I have found that the ability to access sites that are blocked provides a good workaround when your IP address is blocked. Recently, my IP was blocked by my hosting company because I had the wrong password in an email client that kept pinging the server. After enough failed attempts, my IP was blocked so I was no longer able to access any part of the server - CPanel, FTP, WHM. To make matters worse, the hosting company was Site5 - who I would never recommend - and they weren’t responding to support requests. So, to circumvent the block, I simply opened the Tor browser and connected to the server that way. It was a bit slower, but it provided the access that I needed. This is a practical example of how someone who doesn’t face a tyrranical government can use Tor. I can only image living in an atmosphere where it was critical to my survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lynx&quot;&gt;Lynx&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Lynx. If you are old enough, you may remember browsing the internet on a text-based browser like Lynx. For me, Lynx is as much nostalgic as anything else. When I was in college, my first experience with the internet was Lynx. That experience was quickly replaced with a Netscape browser. But, much like those that prefer Vinyl to MP3, I get a warm feeling when I browse a site using Lynx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynx runs through a terminal window and the easiest way to use it is to install the &lt;a href=&quot;http://habilis.net/lynxlet/&quot;&gt;Lynxlet Termlet&lt;/a&gt;. Lynxlet allows you to create a browser bookmark that automatically opens the site that you are currently browsing in Lynx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Assuming you don’t have that same warm and fuzzy feeling that I have for text based browsers, why would you want to do this? If you are a web developer, Lynx is a great way to test the accessibility of your website because it only loads text, avoiding images and javascript. It’s also a great way to see your site the way a web crawler would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the image below, you can see the homepage of this site in the Lynx browser. Plain text is in purple, links are green and links with focus are in yellow. You scroll the page using the up / down arrow keys and you “click” on a link by arrowing down to it and hitting return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/browser-lynx.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Lynx browser window showing gbradhopkins.com homepage&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;Lynx browser window showing gbradhopkins.com homepage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the image above, I can see that my site has navigation issues because the navigation is non-existent. I am using an icon font for the navigation items, and they’re not displayed on a text browser so I should expect that they are not accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/26/get-lynx-for-mac-os-x-10-7-lion/&quot;&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://habilis.net/lynxlet/&quot;&gt;Lynxlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;obligatory-final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Obligatory Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is a great time to experiment with alternative browsers. There seems to be a lot of vibrancy in the browser community. It’s work exploring what else is out there. At the very least, it may reinforce your love of a particular browser.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Working with Ricoh Theta S VR Footage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The process for working with Ricoh Theta S VR files requires a couple intermediate steps before you can import the footage into Premiere. I can’t speak to any other editing software but I would expect it to be the case for others as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-vr-and-why-should-i-care&quot;&gt;What is VR and why should I care?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing that since you are here, you probably know what VR is and are looking for the answer to a specific question. If that’s the case. You can skip this intro section and get right to the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that don’t know what VR is, here is a brief explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VR stands for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality&quot;&gt;Virtual Reality&lt;/a&gt;. You may have seen ads for VR headsets, in which people with giant headsets grasp at thin air and talk about how amazing it is. For the purposes of this article, we’re going to talk about VR as 360 degree video. Consumer priced camera’s like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2fABZfS&quot;&gt;Ricoh Theta S&lt;/a&gt; can record 360 degrees of footage, allowing you to pan around as the video is playing. You can also pause the video and pan around to look at some specific item or area that has been captured. It’s really pretty interesting. Best of all, you don’t need a special headset. Most VR can be viewed using your smartphone (especially when uploaded to YouTube), allowing you to pan around by simply changing the direction that your phone is facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a rough, sample video of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K508tGvjkEs&quot;&gt;walkthrough of my office&lt;/a&gt;, that I created with the Ricoh Theta S. To view the video in VR you must use a supported browser - Chrome or Firefox. Or, you can use your mobile device and the YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed//K508tGvjkEs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want to use a headset, try a &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2fPhdK8&quot;&gt;Google Cardboard compatible headset&lt;/a&gt;. They are pretty cheap and allow you to get a good idea for what VR is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what VR is. It’s time to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-files-off-the-camera&quot;&gt;Getting the files off the camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Theta S mobile app, you can save your VR files directly to your device (iPhone or iPad) and then import them using the Photos app. I prefer to connect the Ricoh camera to my Mac and import them using the Image Capture app. This seems like a more straightforward process to me. The camera doesn’t mount on the desktop when plugged into the Mac, like a GoPro or other camera would, so we need to use the Image Capture app where the camera will show up in your list of devices. Once it shows up, you can then import the files to the location of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to use the imported files as-is they will show up as two spherical images side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vr-spherical-images.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen capture of spherical images&quot; title=&quot;Screen capture of video directly from the Ricoh Theta S&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not what we want. So begins the process of converting - processing - and injecting our files to make them usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before importing into our video editor, we need to convert the files. We can do this using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theta360.com/en/support/download/&quot;&gt;Ricoh Theta app&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of apps available on the download page, including a live streaming app and the mobile apps. We will be using the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://theta360.com/en/about/application/pc.html&quot;&gt;Basic App&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;em&gt;I was somewhat surprised to find that the Basic App was an Adobe AIR application. I’m not sure why that surprised me. I guess it’s because I hadn’t seen an Adobe AIR app in a while.&lt;/em&gt; So, if you don’t have Adobe AIR installed, you will be prompted to download and install that before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;top-and-bottom-orientation-correction&quot;&gt;Top and Bottom Orientation Correction?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to converting the files to a format that can be edited in Premiere, the app also corrects top and bottom orientation in your VR files. Whether you are working with VR files in Premiere or simply uploading to YouTube, you will want to correct the orientation. As I worked through how to prepare files for Premiere, I went through a process of trial and error and was surprised to see that the orientation was incorrect when I uploaded my first VR file to YouTube. Initially, I thought it was a problem with the camera. Then I realized that this needed to be corrected using the Ricoh software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a side note, if you are uploading directly to YouTube, Ricoh provides instructions for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://theta360.com/en/howto-youtube/&quot;&gt;upload to YouTube workflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conversion-process&quot;&gt;Conversion Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversion process is pretty straightforward. Open the Theta App and drop the files that you want to convert on to the main window. You will then be able to select the location to save the converted file, provide a new name and enable top / bottom correction. Depending on the size of the files to be converted, the process can take a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, I have uploaded a raw file from the Ricoh camera and a converted file to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/TTKe1Im5Gy4&quot;&gt;Raw File from Ricoh Theta S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed//TTKe1Im5Gy4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25WfsXS3Ofc&quot;&gt;File converted with Ricoh App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/25WfsXS3Ofc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the file converted with the Ricoh App is the only one that displays properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;importing-into-premiere-finally&quot;&gt;Importing into Premiere (Finally)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the file is converted, you are ready to import it into Premiere and start editing. Editing a VR clip in Premiere is basically the same as with a non-VR video clip. To make previewing your VR content more natural, you will want to enable VR Video display in either the Program or Source monitor. This allows you to pan around your VR the way you would when viewing the video on YouTube. You can read more about this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/kb/work-with-vr.html&quot;&gt;Working with immersive VR video&lt;/a&gt; article on the Adobe Help site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exporting-from-premiere&quot;&gt;Exporting from Premiere&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have finished editing your video in Premiere, the export process is largely unchanged. If you scroll through the settings, you will notice that there is a VR checkbox which should be ticked. Adobe also recommends that you select “Stretch to Fill” in the Source Scaling option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the Format and Preset you select, be certain to change the Source Scaling option in the Export Settings dialog box to Stretch To Fill. If you don’t change this option, you are likely to introduce either letterbox or pillars to the exported video, which breaks the seam of the sphere and distorts it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/kb/work-with-vr.html&quot;&gt;- Working with immersive VR video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the video below, I didn’t use the “Stretch to Fill” option and there is a hole (black area) in the video if you pan down as if looking at the floor..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJUzrqhfe2g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you change those settings, export the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;injecting-meta-data&quot;&gt;Injecting Meta Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the exported file from Premiere, we have one final step which requires another app, this one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/jump/answer/7044297?hl=en&quot;&gt;Spatial Media Metadata Injector&lt;/a&gt; which adds metadata to the file allowing YouTube to recognize it as a spherical file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this app is very straightforward. Simply open the app, select the file, tick the “My video is spherical (360)” checkbox and hit “Inject metadata.” Once the app finishes, you are now ready to upload the app to YouTube. Once the video has been uploaded to YouTube you can use your web browser (currently Chrome and Firefox are compatible with YouTube VR videos), phone (YouTube app) or a VR Viewer like Google Cardboard to explore the VR video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it would be a lot easier if you didn’t have to run your video file through multiple apps to prep it for viewing. I would assume that as the VR format matures and becomes more mainstream, tools like Premiere will do a better job of handling all of these steps. In the mean time, it’s a small price to pay for such an interesting technology.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The One Feature That Keeps Me On Evernote</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of Evernote. So much so, that in &lt;a href=&quot;http://firebrand.media/blog/article/why_i_write_in_evernote&quot;&gt;a previous entry on my business blog&lt;/a&gt;, I outlined the reasons that I thought Evernote was the best software for writing (among other things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, Evernote has made some changes (as software companies have a tendency to do), the most concerning of which is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/226885427-FAQ-About-Migration-to-Google-Cloud-Platform&quot;&gt;migration of data to the Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;. Say what you will about the advantages of the cloud, in the end it boils down to the fact that my data is on someone else’s computer. It is not lost on me that this was always the case. But, now we’ve got another layer of separation between me and my data. So, instead of relying on someone else, I’d like to own and control as much of my data as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I’ve started to explore alternative solutions for many of the cloud based products that I use. As always, the question is, “Does the alternative solution have a practical workflow?” Is it something I can use reliably? The next most important question is “Have I become so reliant on a particular aspect of the current service - in this case Evernote - that it is impractical to change the way I work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ds-note-an-alternative-to-evernote&quot;&gt;DS Note, an Alternative to Evernote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Evernote alternative that I am testing is DS Note, a package of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/6.0/features&quot;&gt;Synology DiskStation&lt;/a&gt; that I have installed on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://iosafe.com/products-216nas-overview&quot;&gt;ioSafe&lt;/a&gt; Network Attached Server (NAS). The ioSafe is a water &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fire proof NAS. Primarily, I have been using it to automatically back up photos from my phones (both iOS and Android) using the DS Photo package. To a lesser extent, I am also using it to store files, a la Dropbox, using the Cloudstation package. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/app_packages/all_app&quot;&gt;a number of packages available&lt;/a&gt;, most with corresponding mobile apps. In fact, if my workflow didn’t include a desktop computer, the one key feature that is keeping me with Evernote would probably be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-key-feature---email-to-evernote&quot;&gt;One Key Feature - Email to Evernote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is it. The deal breaker. With all &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/upgrade/?tier=plus&quot;&gt;paid Evernote accounts&lt;/a&gt;, you get a custom email address allowing you to forward email messages to your account. You can even file them to a specific notebook by adding @notebook-name to the end of the subject line. This has been a huge timesaver for me, as one of my primary uses of Evernote is to store business receipts. Most receipts are in the form of an email which I simply annotate with whatever reference info I need and then forward it to the @receipts notebook in Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no feature like this for DS Note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;close-but-no-cigar&quot;&gt;Close but no cigar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the open, I mentioned that if my workflow didn’t include the desktop I may be able to make DS Note work. With the DS Note mobile app installed on a device, DS Note is an option in any share sheet (see image below). This allows me to create a new note from any email - taking place of the “Email to Evernote” feature that is such a deal breaker for me. It would mean a change in how I work because I’d need to manage any emails that I want to save as notes through a mobile device. I’ve started testing this to see if it is a workable solution. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/DS-Note-share-sheet.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;DS Note in the Spark Email share sheet&quot; title=&quot;DS Note in the Spark Email share sheet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are other Evernote features that have no counterpart in DS Note including &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/webclipper/&quot;&gt;web clipper&lt;/a&gt; (although, if you’re a Chrome user - I’m not - then you’re in luck because there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/synology-web-clipper/pcfbfimijgibligmbglggnbiobgjgmbk&quot;&gt;Synology Web Clipper app&lt;/a&gt; for Chrome), search for text in images, pdfs and handwritten notes, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/05/14/meetings-done-right/&quot;&gt;presentation mode&lt;/a&gt; which I’ve found handy at times. Personally, none of these are deal breakers the way that Email to Evernote is for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of having control of all of my data but if it’s too difficult to actually manage the data, what’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Moving gbradhopkins.com from ExpressionEngine to Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking for an opportunity to play around with Git, Markdown and Jekyll, I have decided to move &lt;a href=&quot;http://gbradhopkins.com&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ellislab.com/expressionengine&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine (EECMS)&lt;/a&gt; - which I love and use on most projects - to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-site-generator&quot;&gt;Static Site Generator?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is a static site generator and why would you want to use it?&lt;/em&gt; I’m glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static site generator takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter and a renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server, or even for free using Github Pages (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static website doesn’t require a database, which can increase security and will typically load faster. &lt;em&gt;Although, there are plenty of ways to slow down a static site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to increased security and speed, Jekyll also creates a local server for testing purposes. Every time you make a change to a file or post, you can preview the change locally before pushing the site live. This is a great time saver, especially when testing a responsive design or a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are using Jekyll, and have a Github account, you can host your site for free using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. You can even use your own domain - as I’m doing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are some restrictions, one being that many of the Jekyll plugins that are available can’t be used because Github runs Jekyll in safe mode. Another restriction that I found is the lack of a .htaccess file, meaning that I couldn’t redirect my pages from their old URL to their new URL. One way that I tried to overcome this was by creating a sitemap and submitting it to Google, using the Google Search Console (formerly Webmaster Tools).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveat&quot;&gt;Caveat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the restrictions mentioned above, there is another major caveat regarding the usage of Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Command Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;http://epwebtech.com/events/2015/08/12/getting-started-with-jekyll.html&quot;&gt;I gave a talk on creating websites with Jekyll.&lt;/a&gt; My first caveat was that you need to use the terminal / command line interface (CLI). I knew that would be a dealbreaker for some people but, if you can overcome your fear of the terminal, using Jekyll can help make you more comfortable with a CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got the why and why not out of the way, let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installing-jekyll-on-a-mac&quot;&gt;Installing Jekyll on a Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the full installation guide, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;check out the Jekyll install documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Here is my quick overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First make sure that you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835&quot;&gt;Xcode&lt;/a&gt; installed. It’s a free download from the app store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the terminal / command line, run the following command to install Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install jekyll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run into an error, first make sure that you have Xcode installed. If Xcode is installed, try installing Jekyll again with this command (which will require that you supply the password for your computer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo gem install jekyll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything goes well, Jekyll will now be installed on your computer and you can start using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to get into the ‘how’ of designing a site with Jekyll. That may be a later blog entry but for now I’m more concerned with the transition from ExpressionEngine to Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bulk-entry-export&quot;&gt;Bulk Entry Export&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating a blog in Jekyll, I wanted to move all/some of my posts from EECMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, what follows is a bit of a cheat. I wanted to export my entries from EECMS to Jekyll but I just couldn’t figure out how without putting in a bunch of time that I didn’t have. So, instead, I came up with the following solution that I used to export &lt;em&gt;ALL&lt;/em&gt; of my entries from EECMS to a single HTML file. This file exports each entry as a field in a table. Because most of my entries were old and no longer relevant, I was satisfied to use this as more of a time capsule, or archive, so that in the future I can look back at what I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php
    header(&quot;Content-type: application/vnd.ms-excel&quot;);
header(&quot;Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=gbradhopkins-entries-exports.xls&quot;);
header(&quot;Pragma: no-cache&quot;);
header(&quot;Expires: 0&quot;);
?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
{exp:channel:entries channel='tutorials' limit='500' disable=&quot;categories|member_data|pagination|trackbacks&quot;}
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
	    &amp;lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&amp;gt;{title}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{tutorial_body}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{tutorial_image}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{tutorial_hero_image}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
{/exp:channel:entries}
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exporting-individual-entries&quot;&gt;Exporting Individual Entries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most, exporting a single file that includes every entry is probably not practical and, honestly if I could figure it out, I wanted to maintain the entries as individual files as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I love most about ExpressionEngine is the ability to format and display your data however you need. Using two templates I was able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List all of my entries with the naming convention that Jekyll requires - “Year-Month-Day-Title.md” - I was set on using Markdown so the .md format was important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click a link to download each entry formatted for Jekyll with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;front matter&lt;/a&gt; already in place - layout, title, categories, date, custom image field for hero images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List of Entries Template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple template but it gets the job done, creating a list of entries with links to download the individual files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;review_hero_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;image:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;review_hero_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;exp:marker:tomarkdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;tutorial_hero_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;tutorial_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;tutorial_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;review_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/exp:marker:tomarkdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/exp:channel:entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I couldn’t figure out was how to download the file with the .md file extension. Using the above code downloads a file with .md.html as the file extension. I simply used a renaming app to batch rename all of the files to .md.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then dropped the files in my _posts directory, rebuilt my site and pushed the changes to my Github account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-more-thing&quot;&gt;One More Thing…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll build&lt;/code&gt; after you make changes to your site. Whether it be a post, config file, css file… whatever. This command rebuilds your site and all changes are made and regenerated to the static site files found in the _site directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll build&lt;/code&gt; and then push the site to Git, your server… wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Basic Git Commands</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Generally, I don’t use the command line to interact with my version controlled client accounts. In most cases, I prefer to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.git-tower.com&quot;&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a great Git client for Mac and Windows but in the case of gbradhopkins.com, I decided to use the command line as a way of becoming more familiar with it. Below are the basic commands that I use to push content to my Github account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps for commiting new or updated content to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firebrandmedia&quot;&gt;Github account&lt;/a&gt;. As I use Git more, hopefully these will become muscle memory and I’ll no longer need this document. Until then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;commands-for-pushing-content&quot;&gt;Commands for pushing content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating or editing a file, run the following commands in the Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an optional command. It simply shows what has changed and results in something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;modified:   _includes/head.html
modified:   _sass/_gbradhopkins.scss
modified:   css/main.scss
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then review the list of changes and if satisfied, move to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit -m 'Commit message here'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adding our commit message and hitting enter, we receive a message indicating what we’ve done (or are about to do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
[gh-pages c5656de] git article update
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. All done. The files are now commited to the repository that we’ve been working in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, how to access that repository from another computer to continue working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ripping a DVD to iPod Video on Windows XP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Update - 7/03/13 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/article/1157590/how_to_rip_dvd_handbrake.html&quot;&gt;Macworld decided to one up me and provided their own, in-depth instruction guide on how to rip a DVD with handbrake. They go into a lot more detail than I did. Read mine first, and then, if you still can’t figure it out or need more help, check out their guide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If like me, you still have an iPod Video around, you may decide that you want to use it to store movies for when you travel, after all, you can hook it up to a TV using the video out cable so it makes a pretty good movie storage device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-handbrake&quot;&gt;Enter Handbrake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“HandBrake is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.” Best of all, it’s free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr/&quot;&gt;Handbrake&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr/features.php&quot;&gt;number of features&lt;/a&gt; that you can use to tweak your video to your liking and export in the format that you need. In addition to the ability to specify your export settings, Handbrake has a number of built in pre-sets that allow for one-click setting of the export. Primarily, I use Handbrake to rip DVDs which I play through my AppleTV so I just use the appropriate AppleTV export preset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-handbrake&quot;&gt;Using Handbrake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following steps, I’m going to show you how to export video for iPod Video and then add it to iTunes but it’s basically the same for any Apple device (iPhone, iPod Touch, AppleTV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to download and install Handbrake. This will also install the .NET framework if it is not already installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Handbrake is installed, the process is pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select the Preset.&lt;/strong&gt; Select iPod (or whichever your destination device is). If you select iPod, make sure that iPod 5G Support is enabled via the Output Settings checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Handbrake_Step_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Step 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select the Source.&lt;/strong&gt; Click on the source icon, and then select Open Folder. You will now browse My Computer and find the name of the DVD in the device list. In the screenshot below, I selected the DVD, A Bugs Life to rip and then click on OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handbrake will then scan the source for the video to be ripped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Handbrake_Step_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Step 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, give the file a name - ie. A Bugs Life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Handbrake_Step_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Step 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, click on the Start button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Handbrake_Step_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Step 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handbrake will now rip the DVD to the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Handbrake has completed the encoding process, the file will be on your desktop - or the destination location that you selected. Once ripped, using the iPod 5G settings, the .MP4 file is around 542MB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can drag the .MP4 file into your iTunes library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/iTunes_Step_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iTunes Step 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the movie is not showing up in your Movies directory in iTunes. That’s because the video that was exported is categorized as a “Home Video” so it is found in the Home Videos directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change this, right click on the movie and select “Get Info.” &lt;em&gt;I’m doing this on a Mac so I’m not sure what it is on Windows but I would guess that it is similar.&lt;/em&gt; Under “Media Kind” select Movie instead of Home Video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/iTunes_Step_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iTunes Step 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, your ripped video will should be displayed under Movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/iTunes_Step_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iTunes Step 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, go into the settings for your iPod and select the check box next to the movie to indicate that it should be synched to your device. Now, hit “Apply” and the movie will be synched to the iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/iTunes_Step_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iTunes Step 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
